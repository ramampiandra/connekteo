## R&D on IoT infrastruture and implementation for Madagascar
The Internet of Things (IoT) is the network of physical objectsâ€”devices, vehicles, buildings and other items which are embedded with electronics, software, sensors, and network connectivity, which enables these objects to collect and exchange data. Implementing this concept is not an easy task by any measure for many reasons including the complex nature of the different components of the ecosystem of IoT.
